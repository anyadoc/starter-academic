Aniruddha Belsare is a disease ecologist with a background in veterinary medicine, pathogen modeling, and conservation research. He uses an interdisciplinary approach that incorporates ecologic, epidemiologic and model-based investigations to understand how pathogens spread through, persist in, and impact host populations. One of the main objectives of Aniruddha’s research is to translate insights gained from an analytical approach into actionable outcomes for managers and policymakers.
