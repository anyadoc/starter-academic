summary: Applied epidemiological research using agent-based models.
abstract: "Agent-based modeling is a computational method that is widely used to understand complex systems. The use and ubiquity of agent-based models is especially growing in fields like population health science and epidemiology. Belsare will discuss how an agent-based modeling approach can be used to investigate disease dynamics in wildlife and/or synanthropic host populations. He will also discuss the use of simulation modeling to ‘test drive’ disease management interventions and determine their effectivity."
