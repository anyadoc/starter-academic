summary: Applied epidemiological research using agent-based models.
abstract: "Agent-based models are increasingly being used to investigate complex real-world systems. In this talk, I discuss how agent-based models can be used to better understand host-pathogen dynamics in complex wildlife disease systems. I use two of my research projects, West Nile virus and Chronic Wasting Disease to show how virtual experimentation using agent-based models can inform public health and conservation strategies."
