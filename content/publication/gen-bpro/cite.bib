abstract = {Baylisascaris procyonis is a nematode of significant concern to public and domestic animal health as well as wildlife management. The population genetics of B. procyonis is poorly understood. To gain insights into patterns of genetic diversity within (infrapopulation level) and among (component population level) raccoon (Procyon lotor) hosts, and specifically to assess the relative importance of indirect and direct transmission of the parasite for explaining observed population structure, we collected 69 B. procyonis from 17 wild raccoons inhabiting five counties in Missouri and Arkansas, USA. Informative regions of mitochondrial (CO1, CO2) and nuclear (28S, ITS2) genes were amplified and the distribution and genetic variability of these genes were assessed within and across raccoons. Concatenation of the CO1 and CO2 mtDNA sequences resulted in 5 unique haplotypes, with haplotype diversity 0.456 ± 0.068. The most common haplotype occurred in 94{\%} of raccoons and 72.5{\%} of B. procyonis. Sequences for 28S rDNA revealed four unique nuclear genotypes, the most common found in 100{\%} of raccoons and 82.6{\%} of B. procyonis. ITS2 genotypes were assessed using fragment analysis, and there was a 1:1 correspondence between 28S and ITS-2 genotypes. Infrapopulation variation in haplotypes and genotypes was high and virtually all hosts infected with multiple sequenced nematodes also harbored multiple haplotypes and genotypes. There was a positive relationship between the size of the analyzed infrapopulation (i.e., the number of nematodes analyzed) and the number of haplotypes identified in an individual. Collectively this work emphasizes the importance of indirect transmission in the lifecycle to this parasite.},
