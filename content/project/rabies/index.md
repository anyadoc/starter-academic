title: Free-roaming dogs and canine rabies in India
summary: The objective of this collaborative, OneHealth research project is to use viral genome sequencing, dog demography and epidemiological modeling to better understand the mechanisms of persistence  and  dispersal of  canine  rabies, and find focused, efficient strategies for interrupting dog-to-dog transmission of rabies virus in resource-limited settings.

Our overarching goal is to make a major contribution to eliminating dog-mediated human rabies deaths in the Indian subcontinent by identifying optimal strategies for interrupting dog-to-dog transmission of rabies virus in resource limited settings. The  World  Health  Organization (WHO) has set  the  goal  of  zero  human  deaths  from  dog-mediated  rabies  by  2030. 

Rabies  kills  an  estimated  59,000  people every  year (20,000 in India), and most  of  these  deaths  are  from  the  poorest  sectors  of society. As dogs are the principal reservoir of rabies in  low-and  middle-income  countries in Asia and Africa, interrupting transmission of rabies in this reservoir population should address the source of the problem and provide long-term public health and economic benefits. The proposed  mechanism  for  accomplishing  this  is  through  vaccinating dogs at  high  enough  coverage  (70%)  to  achieve  herd  immunity.

Achieving and  sustaining  high  vaccination  coverage across  large  geographic  scale  presents a  daunting challenge for a country like India which has the largest  free-ranging  dog  population  in  the  world  (59 million). Dogs are often loosely owned by the communities, thus there is a reliance on community participation to access dogs. High population turnover rates of free-ranging dog populations further add to the logistical difficulties of sustaining vaccination coverage. Thus current approach  to  eliminating rabies  by  rapidly  vaccinating  70%  of  the dogs  is  unrealistic  in  India. At present, rabies and dog population control programs in India are limited to a few urban centers. Such 'top down' approaches (mass dog vaccination funded and implemented by non-government organizations) may seem promising in the shorter term, but a smarter, more  nuanced  strategy is  necessary for sustained control of canine rabies at a larger geographic scale.

What is needed is a strategy that will ensure  efficient allocation of resources for sustainable  gains. We need  to  know  where  and  how  the  virus  persists  and by  what  pathway  of  transmission  it  arrives in rural  places, as most dog-mediated  human rabies deaths occur in rural areas of India.

Central  Hypothesis:  Our  scientific  hypothesis  is  that  rabies  arrives  recurrently  in  rural  dog  populations  through  stepping-stone  dispersal  originating  in  urban  populations  where  the  disease  is endemic.  Because  dog  population  size  is  large  in urban  areas  and  small  in  rural  villages,  we  also  hypothesize  that  stochasticity  is important in  persistence  (or  lack  thereof).

Using whole genome sequencing of rabies virus isolates, we hope to elucidate  population  structure  and  dispersal  patterns  of  rabies  virus  along  urban-rural gradient. Our field-based research will investigate dog demography using mark-resight techniques. We are developing epidemiological models  of  rabies  dynamics to  understand  persistence  and  transmission,  and  to  compare  interventions. The  models are being used to compare  alternative  interventions: where  and  when  should we  vaccinate,  deploy  animal  birth  control,  promote  garbage  management,  and  focus  monitoring. We  will leverage  these  results  in  a  larger  proposal  where  we  will  scale up  to  the  national  level.

Free-roaming dog population management is an important component of human rabies elimination efforts: https://avbelsare.netlify.app/publication/dpopm/

Free-roaming dogs are also responsible for serious and fatal attacks on humans. Here's a link to published reports from India in 2022: https://anyadoc.github.io/FRDattacks-India/
