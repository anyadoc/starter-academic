title: One Health Modeling Framework
summary: Given the interconnectedness of animal health, environmental health and human health/well-being, it is necessary to investigate the ecological context of animal disease systems that have public health, conservation or economic implications. Such host-pathogen systems are highly complex and heterogeneous, and often, our understanding of such systems is fraught with uncertainties. Our aim is to develop and use models to elucidate host-pathogen dynamics in such systems, and translate the insights gained into actionable outcomes for effective and meaningful management of diseases. At present, I continue to work on canine rabies, leptospirosis and Lyme disease. I am also developing a conceptual framework for informing policies on emerging zoonoses.

I was the leader of the OneHealth Modeling Working Group at the Center for Modeling Complex Interactions, University of Idaho, Moscow, Idaho. The main objective of this working group was to develop and use analytical, model-based approaches to better understand and manage complex zoonotic disease systems.I continue to work on this theme and new collaborations are in the pipeline.
