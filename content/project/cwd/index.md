title: Chronic Wasting Disease Modeling Framework
summary: The CWD modeling project began in 2014 in collaboration Josh Millspaugh (University of Montana), Matt Gompper (University of Missouri, later New Mexico State University) and Missouri Department of Conservation. We developed an agent-based modeling framework for assessing the efficacy of harvest-based disease surveillance in white-tailed deer populations of Missouri. We also developed a spatially-explicit, agent-based model of chronic wasting disease transmission in white-tailed deer populations. This model was used to assess the rate of CWD spread in Missouri, as well as to evaluate alternate management strategies to limit the spread of CWD. The CWD Modeling Framework was subsequently (2019-2021) adapted to simulate Michigan white-tailed deer populations and then applied to assess alternate harvest strategies for their impact on CWD spread. I also collaborated with Atle Mysterud (University of Oslo) and Hildegunn Viljugrein (Norwegian Veterinary Institute) to apply the modeling framework to reindeer populations, and we assessed surveillance and harvest strategies for the reindeer populations of Norway. The CWD modeling framework is also being used to inform CWD management in Indiana (in collaboration with Purdue University) and Texas (supported by a USDA-APHIS grant). Current work on assessing public practices  like baiting, supplemental feeding and carcass movements for their impact on the establishment and spread of CWD in regional deer populations is supported by a grant from the Safari Club International Foundation.

The agent-based modeling framework that I developed as a component of my postdoctoral research on chronic wasting disease (CWD) facilitates applied wildlife epidemiological research and is being used by several wildlife agencies as a decision support tool to guide their CWD management strategies. I have also developed and published user-friendly apps to communicate nuanced and complex disease management issues to stakeholders (e.g., https://rpubs.com/anyadoc/OvCWD_APR ). I am now using this modeling framework to investigate ecological and evolutionary consequences of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in white-tailed deer.
