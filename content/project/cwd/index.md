The Next Frontier of CWD Models in Michigan: An Agent-Based Approach for Surveillance and Management Assessment (2019-2020; Led by Aniruddha Belsare).

The introduction of CWD into captive and free-ranging deer in Michigan represents a serious long-term threat to the health of the free-ranging deer population. Knowledge of the effects of a CWD infection on population-level survival rates and the impacts on population densities is relatively limited, but studies in western states indicate that CWD can have negative impacts on deer populations.
Given the importance of white-tailed deer in Michigan, a thorough understanding of the dynamics of CWD in Michigan and of the impacts the disease might have on Michigan's deer is needed. A spatially-explicit, agent-based modeling framework was developed to inform CWD surveillance and management strategies for Missouri's white-tailed deer populations [Belsare et al., 2020]. Missouri models can be downloaded from the CoMSES Model Library: https://doi.org/10.25937/cnex-s628 & https://doi.org/10.25937/8hpz-9y96

The modeling framework is now adapted to simulate Michigan white-tailed deer populations. This framework is being used to better understand CWD dynamics in the white-tailed deer populations within Michigan's landscapes. The insights gained from our analytical approach will allow biologists and managers to evaluate and optimize current and future CWD surveillance and management strategies within Michigan. Specifically, the focus is on 1) informing a sustainable CWD surveillance strategy so as to confidently detect CWD in areas where it has not yet been found; 2) determining the prevalence and distribution of CWD in affected areas; and 3) designing management strategies to limit the further spread of CWD. Michigan CWD models can be downloaded from the CoMSES Model Library: https://doi.org/10.25937/kv07-3e08,  https://doi.org/10.25937/fdke-rp28 and https://doi.org/10.25937/6qeq-1c13
